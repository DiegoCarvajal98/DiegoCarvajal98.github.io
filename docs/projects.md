## Teleoperation System for a Robot Manipulator with Gripper Haptic Feedback

During this project, I developed a teleoperation system or a UR3 robot manipulator using my programming skills with python and C++ to estimate the pose of the user's hand and control the robot and its gripper with ROS, my hardware design skills for the design of the electronics and mechanical components needed in the haptic tool and gripper force sensing systems.

## Control of a Robot Manipulator with EEG Data for Object Manipulation Tasks

Throughout the development of this project, I used my programming skills with python and C++ as well as Matlab to program a UR3 robot manipulator to pick one of five possible objects according to the result from a machine learning model and Brain-Computer Interface data and place it at a determined location using ROS for the robot control and object detection.
